### What is Kinematics vs Dynamics vs Machanics?
This is the first question when I heard of these 3 terms. They all frequently appear in Robotics books and sometimes appear together.\
\
 Let's first understand their definitions from Webster:
- Kinematics: branch of dynamics that deals with aspects of
motion **apart from considerations of mass and force**
- Dynamics: branch of mechanics that **deals with forces** and
their **relation primarily to the motion** but sometimes also
to the equilibrium of bodies
- Mechanics: branch of physical science that deals with
**energy and forces and their effect on bodies**

### Forward vs Inverse Kinematics
- Forward: Where is the end-effector based on a given configuration?
- Inverse: Where do the joints have to be to place the end-effector?

### End Effector Pose (operational space)

X is composed of position and direction

### Rotation Matrix
Here's a derivation of the rotation matrix:

### Translation Matrix
t = (t1,t2,t3).transpose()

### Homogenerous Transformations (HTs)

### 3 Uses of HTs
1. Frame Description

2. Mapping between frames

3. Transform a point

### Conclusion
I guess some of you might be wondering: **so, why do we need Kinematics?**

Actualy, the reasons are covered above already:
- Forward: Where is the end-effector based on a given configuration?
- Inverse: Where do the joints have to be to place the end-effector?
